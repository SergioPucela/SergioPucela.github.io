									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>The Redress of Mira is a first person walking simulator that takes you on a journey through a fantasy world. It's a narrative-heavy 
										game but it's still has some space for minor combat encounters, small puzzles, and platforming.
									<br><br>
									This was the first project where I worked all alone from start to finish, from reworking the save system for consoles to optimizing all of 
									the assets used in the game. You could say that my role on this project was both from a developer and a producer perspective.
									<h3>Biggest challenge I've faced on this project?</h3>One of the biggest pros of this game is how gorgeous it's environments look
									mixed with it's beautiful soundtrack, so I had to make sure everything looked as good as the PC version... which might sound easier than it was, 
									because the optimization here was not that great, and both PlayStation and Xbox also had it's own rendering-specific problems. The good news is that 
									the game was not something complex at a technical level, so the console development went very smoothly.
									<br><br>
									<h3>Biggest lesson I've learned on this project?</h3>Never take something for granted on porting. If it looks good on one platform, it may 
									still look horribly wrong in another one. Also, damn you tesselation (you're almost always the problem with material issues on consoles).</p>
