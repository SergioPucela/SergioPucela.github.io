									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>Quantum Fields is a first-person puzzle game where the players wake up at some kind of abandoned place. Soon, they'll find a strange 
									weapon that will help them create some portals connecting to the past... Maybe something in one era will help them in the other one? 
									Will they be able to escape?
									<br><br>
									The game's puzzles were designed with the player's ability to shoot a maximum of 3 quantum orbs in mind (if you shoot a 4th one, the 1st one will disappear and so on), 
									and everything from the past that you take from one orb will get reset after making that orb disappear! You can vanish your orbs at will by shooting 
									another one at them, but the players also have the ability to recover them in the same order that they spawned (very useful if you don't have them on sight).
									<br><br>
									My role here mainly focused on programming and designing how the weapon works, which lead me to be the designer of the game's puzzles as well. 
									Since the weapon is the main tool for the player on this game, it had to be one of the most polished areas in the project.
